650,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,in order to give the arrow pointing up enough space we should move the top edge of the rectangle down by the length of the arrow.,0,0,Collaborators
651,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,first of all we should ask the rectangle shape to give us its top edge method blrectangleshape #topedge .,0,0,Collaborators

409,BlLayout,"every frame, the space goes through several phases method blspaceframe #initializephases .",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
410,BlLayout,phases are modeled as subclasses of class blspaceframephase and are executed once per frame.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
411,BlLayout,"one of them, class blspaceframelayoutphase , consists in layouting the elements contained in the space.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
412,BlLayout,"this is done after events and tasks have been executed, but before the drawing phase.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
413,BlLayout,"layouting should to be executed during a frame when various properties like, width, height or position change in any element contained by the space.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
414,BlLayout,"however, an important aspect in bloc, is that when one of these properties changes, layouting is not performed immediately.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
415,BlLayout,"instead, a layout request is issued by the element whose property changed using the message method blelement #requestlayout .",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
416,BlLayout,"this has the advantage that if no element request layout, this phase can be skipped.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
417,BlLayout,also it does not matter if layout is requeste one or 1000 time only one layout phase is performed improving performance.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
418,BlLayout,"hence, in bloc layout is not executed immediately after a property like the width of an element changes.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
419,BlLayout,"instead layout is requested and perfomed, if needed, during every frame.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
420,BlLayout,"when needing to test layouts, however, it is necessary to apply a layout immediately, instead of waiting for a frame to end.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
421,BlLayout,"that can be done using the messafe method blelement #forcelayout this should not be used outside of tests, as it bypasses the normal layouting system from bloc.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
423,BlLayout,"however, often elements need to reach and perform actions, when for example their position or extent changes.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
424,BlLayout,they can react by requesting another layout.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
425,BlLayout,a tipical example is deadling with edges.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
426,BlLayout,an edge can be layouted only after the position of the elements that it connects is known.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
427,BlLayout,"hence, often the layout needs to be applied twice, or more, during the layouting phase.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
428,BlLayout,"the space only allows layout requests during the layouting phase a limited number of times method blspace #computelayout to avoid blocking rendering due to infinite recursions caused by layout requests, or void spending too much time on layouts in a frame.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
429,BlLayout,"more technical details can be found in the method method blspace #dolayout , the main entry point for executing the layout phase in a space.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
430,BlLayout,performing a layout,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
431,BlLayout,the space starts the layouting process on the root element of that space.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
432,BlLayout,performing the layout on an element consists in executing three main steps,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
177,BlElementDynamicTransformation,it means that matrix computation is performed only when requested taking owner element into account.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
437,BlLayout,measuring bounds,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
438,BlLayout,this is the first step when performing a layout on an element and consists in determening the measured bounds of that element.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
439,BlLayout,each element can decide how it wants to be measured method blelement #onmeasure .,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
440,BlLayout,by default class blelement delegates the measuring to its layout.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
441,BlLayout,layouts should override method bllayout #measure with to implement the actual measuring.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
442,BlLayout,normally layouts follow a top to bottom approach they measure the current element and then asks its children to do the measuring.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
443,BlLayout,each element has real bounds blelement #bounds and measured bounds blelement #measuredbounds .,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
444,BlLayout,the real bounds contain the actual position and extent of an element that users of that element should rely on.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
1468,GtRlBaselineTagReleaseStrategy,as i am passive i do not export any metadata.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
445,BlLayout,the measured bounds are used during layouting to hold the new extent of an element.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
1469,GtRlBaselineTagReleaseStrategy,even if the repository has child repositories there will be no metadata exported.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
446,BlLayout,the measuring phase changes only the extent in the measured bounds.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
1470,GtRlBaselineTagReleaseStrategy,because of this i do not use metadata to check previous versions it is not reliable .,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
447,BlLayout,after the entire layout phase is completed the real bounds and measured bounds will have the same value.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
448,BlLayout,the measured bounds act like a temporary cache for the new bounds of an element.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
449,BlLayout,they were introduced to avoid changing the real extent of element while layouting of children is still being performed.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
450,BlLayout,todo explain why position is sometime changed in the measured bounds,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints

455,BlLayout,measurement top to bottom though all the composition of elements.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
456,BlLayout,this step find the size of an element and sets measuredextent or position sometimes,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
457,BlLayout,space starts the layout step,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
458,BlLayout,as we know the size of each child we compute the actual position for each child,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
459,BlLayout,changes the real extent to measured extent and the real position to the computed layout position,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
1483,GtRlCommitAndTagReleaseAction,i only work with strategies of type class gtrlsemantictagreleasestrategy .,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
460,BlLayout,elements announce events for position and extent changed,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
1484,GtRlCommitAndTagReleaseAction,see method gtrlsemantictagreleasestrategy #commitandtagrelease for more implementation details.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
461,BlLayout,without event handlers the layout process is going to happen only once.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
462,BlLayout,for example when nodes change the position edges should be updated.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints

246,BlGridLayout,all children of an element with gridlayout must use gridconstraints that allows users to configure how children are located within grid independently.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints

1529,SpartaCairoTextMetrics,"because text extents are in user space coordinates, they are mostly, but not entirely, independent of the current transformation matrix.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints

1530,SpartaCairoTextMetrics,"if you call cairo scale cr, 20, 20 , text will be drawn twice as big, but the reported text extents will not be doubled.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
251,BlGridLayout,children are allowed to have fitcontent and exact resizing modes.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
1531,SpartaCairoTextMetrics,"they will change slightly due to hinting so you can t assume that metrics are independent of the transformation matrix , but otherwise will remain unchanged.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
252,BlGridLayout,because child s matchparent does not make sense in case of grid users should use #fill to declare that child should take all available cell s space.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
253,BlGridLayout,"by default grid layout does not specify how many columns and rows exist, instead it tries to compute necessary amount of columns or rows depending on amount of children.",0,1,Keyimplementationpoints
254,BlGridLayout,user can specify amount of columns or rows by sending columncount or rowcount to an instance of grid layout.,0,1,Keyimplementationpoints

640,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,"the goal of this tutorial is to create an element with an arrow like pointer in the middle of the top edge, as shown below",0,1,Example
641,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #elementwithtoparrowgeometry nocode previewshow gtlivefor previewheight 250,1,1,Example
642,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,"a traditional way to implement such geometry is to create a subclass of class blgeometry , override method blgeometry #buildpathonspartacanvas and implement quite cumbersome algorithm that computes the location of each point and then connects those points using moveto and lineto commands provided by pathbuilder .",0,1,Example
643,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,"the problem with such solution is its exponential increase in compolexity each time we would like to parametrize and customize the resulting geometry, for example the size of the arrow or its horizontal position.",1,1,Example
644,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,"even more compex would be to implement the support for positioning the arrow on different edges eg left, bottom or an ability to have multiple arrows on separate edges.",0,1,Example
645,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,this is where a class blvectorshape comes in handy.,1,1,Example
646,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,creating a rectangle shape,0,1,Example
647,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,we will start with creation of the rectangle shape class blrectangleshape,1,1,Example

649,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,translating the top edge,1,1,Example
650,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,in order to give the arrow pointing up enough space we should move the top edge of the rectangle down by the length of the arrow.,0,1,Example
651,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,first of all we should ask the rectangle shape to give us its top edge method blrectangleshape #topedge .,1,1,Example
652,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,by default the topedge of the rectangle is an instance of class bllineshape which can be translated by sending method bllineshape #moveby to the topedge,0,1,Example
653,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #rectanglewithtranslatedtopedge previewshow #gtlivefor previewexpanded true previewheight 250,1,1,Example
654,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,injecting a line inside of the top edge,0,1,Example
655,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,next step on our way to the arrow is to inject a line segment equal to the length of the arrow in the middle of the topedge .,1,1,Example
656,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,it can be done by sending method bllineshape #injectlineat length to the topedge .,0,1,Example
657,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,since we want to inject a line right in the middle of the edge we pass 05 as a line location,1,1,Example
658,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #rectanglewithtopinjectedline previewshow #gtlivefor previewexpanded true previewheight 250,0,1,Example
659,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,splitting the injected line,0,1,Example
660,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,we are almost ready to create a rectangular arrow.,0,1,Example
149,BlDevScripterCheckFiredEventsStep,example,0,1,Example
661,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,we just need to split an injected line in half in order to create the top corner of the rectangle.,0,1,Example
150,BlDevScripterCheckFiredEventsStep,here you can see how to configure a fire and check a click event on a child element,0,1,Example
662,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,we can do so by sending a method bllineshape #splitat to the now middle section of the topedge which was created by the previous line injection step,0,1,Example
663,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #rectanglewithtoppolylinesplitinhalf previewshow #gtlivefor previewexpanded true previewheight 250,0,1,Example
664,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,moving the top of the triangle,0,1,Example
665,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,once we have everything we need for the arrow triangle we can move it s top up by the length of the arrow.,0,1,Example
666,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,to do so we should send method blpointshape #moveby to the connection point of the splitted line in the middle of the topedge .,0,1,Example
667,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,after doing so we receive the expected vector shape we we can later use together with class blshapegeometry,0,1,Example

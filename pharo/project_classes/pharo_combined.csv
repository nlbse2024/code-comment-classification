Seaside,WALabelledFormDialog,"WALabelledFormDialog is an abstract class for generating html forms. Given a data model WALabelledFormDialog displays a label and input field for each instance variable of interest. User supplied data is placed in the data model.

Subclasses need to implment the methods labelForSelector:, model, and rows. The ""model"" method just returns the object whose fields we wish to populate with date. The ""rows"" method returns a collections of symbols. One symbol for each row of data in the dialog. The symbol is used generate the accessor methods for the data in the model. The method ""labelForSelector:"" returns the labels for each row and each submit button in the form.

A standard text input field is used for each row of data. To use other html widgets for input for = a datum implement the method renderXXXOn: where XXX is the symbol for the row. See ""renderNameOn:"" in example below.

The default form has one button ""Ok"". Override the ""buttons"" method to change the text or number of submit buttons on the form. Override the ""defaultButton"" method to indicate which button is the default. For each button in the form the subclass needs a method with the same name as the button, which is called when the user clicks that button. See example below.

GToolkit,GtGradAbstractTreeLayout,"This an implementation of a Moen's tree layout algorithm.
Moen's algorithm attempts to create a tree with a triangular shape and place nodes somewhat simetrically. It is an extension of the well-known Reingold-Tilfold algorithm. It improved the older algorithm's ability to handle non-uniform sized nodes. Moen's trees are oriented horizontally. However, this implementation offers the posibility of choosing the orientation - vertical or horizontal. 

The Reingold-Tilfold  algorithm, and thus Moen's also,  starts with a bottom-up traversal of the tree. It calculates left and right subtrees of a tree and merges them. When doing that, it makes sure that the parents are centered above their children. Reignold-Tilfold's algorithm  was originally designed only for binary trees, but later extended to work for non-binary ones as well.  While Reignold-Tilfold's algorithm produces a compact tree layout, Moen's strives to make a tighter one. To accomplish that, it uses shapes represented by polyline structures. These shapes are initially formed for each leaf, so that the polyline goes around the node, but leaves the left side open. During the first phase of the algorithm's execution (bottom-up traversal), these shapes  are merged - shapes of parents are merged with shapes of children. In this implementation, we call the polylines contours. When merging contours, minimum horizontal/vertical offsets at which siblings can be placed with resepct to  their upper (left) sibling (depending of the layout's orientation) are calculated

Once the bottom-up traversal is finished,  calculation of offsets is finished as well. At that point, the tree is traversed again, but this time from top (root) to the bottom. During this second traversal, positions of the tree's nodes are set. Calculation of positions factors in the mentioned offsets, as well as the positions of the node's parent and the layout's  node and level distance properties.

Additionally, this implementation supports alignment of  nodes (top, center, bottom in case of the vertical layout and left, center, right in case of the horizontal layout). This is done through calculation of differences in sizes of nodes compared to the largest nodes on the same level, as well as the differences in sizes of their parents compared to the largest nodes on the parent level.

GtGradTreeLayout is  a superclass of GtGradHorizontalTreeLayout and GtGradVerticalTreeLayout classes and  contains generic tree layout methods and definitions of methods the two subclasses need to redefine.

GToolkit,BlTextElementMeasurementStrategyExamples,"! Text measurement strategies

${class:BlTextElement}$ provides different text measurement strategies, each suitable for a specific use case. There is no perfect strategy, therefore understanding the differences between them is an important step in learning how to work with Text in Bloc.

!! Label measurement

The default text measurement strategy is so called ==Label measurement==, ${method:BlTextElement>>#labelMeasurement}$. The height of the text element in this case is a sum of ascent and descent which is given by the font. It means that the height of the text is independent from the content. The width is given by the exact bounds of the element's text. ==Label measurement== is useful for displaying labels and short pieces of text. Please note, that since the width is precise and depends on the content, whitespace is not taken into account when computing the width of the text element.

The algorithm is implemented as described in the paper by Mark Bruls, Kees Huizing, and Jarke J. van Wij, ""Squarified Treemaps"" [*PDF>https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf*].

!! Algorithm Explanation

This is an adapted extract from the paper Squarified Treemaps mentioned above. Suppose we have a rectangle with width ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodes|label=#width}$ and height ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodes|label=#height}$, and furthermore suppose that this rectangle must be subdivided in seven rectangles with areas ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodes|label=#nodeValues}$. The area will be subdivided as follows:
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodes|noCode|codeExpanded=false|previewExpanded=true|previewShow=#gtPreviewFor:}$

The *first step* of our algorithm is to split the initial rectangle. We choose for a horizontal subdivision, because the original rectangle is wider than high. We next fill the left half. First we add a single rectangle. The aspect ratio of this first rectangle is ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesFirstStep|label=#worstValueRounded}$.

${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesFirstStep|previewExpanded=true|noCode}$

Next we add a second rectangle, above the first. The worst aspect ratio improves to ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesSecondStep|label=#worstValueRounded}$.
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesSecondStep|previewExpanded=true|noCode}$

However, if we add the next (area 4) above these original rectangles, the aspect ratio of this rectangle is ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesThirdStep|label=#worstValueRounded}$.
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesThirdStep|previewExpanded=true|noCode}$

Therefore, we decide that we have reached an optimum for the left half in step two, and start processing the right half. The initial subdivision we choose here is vertical, because the rectangle is higher than wider. In step 4 we add the rectangle with area 4:
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesFourthStep|previewExpanded=true|noCode}$

In the next step, we add area 3. The worst aspect ratio decreases from ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesFourthStep|label=#worstValueRounded}$ to ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesFifthStep|label=#worstValueRounded}$: 
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesFifthStep|previewExpanded=true|noCode}$

Addition of the next (area 2) however does not improve the result as the worst aspect ratio increases from ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesFifthStep|label=#worstValueRounded}$ to ${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesSixthStep|label=#worstValueRounded}$:
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesSixthStep|previewExpanded=true|noCode}$

So we reject the previous step and start to fill the right top partition:
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodesSeventhStep|previewExpanded=true|noCode}$
 
These steps are repeated until all rectangles have been processed. The final result is the following:
${example:GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples>>#squarifyWithSevenNodes|noCode|codeExpanded=false|previewExpanded=true}$.

An optimal result can not be guaranteed, and counterexamples can be set up. The order in which the rectangles are processed is important. We found that a decreasing order usually gives the best results. The initially large rectangle is then filled in first with the larger subrectangles.",10-113,,,"I use ${method:GtGraphTreemapNode>>#weight}$ node values to split an area into.

GToolkit,SpartaCanvas,"! SpartaCanvas
I represent a Sparta canvas and provide an API to perform various drawing operations.
I define an abstract API of Sparta canvas that all concrete implementations must have.

!! Overview
My main responsibility is to create and provide backend specific builders and various objects.

In order to create and perform a drawing operation users should rely on corresponding builder.
For example if one wants to fill a path with a paint she needs to send #fill message to canvas to get a fill builder (painter).

There is a separate builder for every single operation. They can be found in ""api"" protocol.

I'm also responsible for creation of filter primitives (filter types) that are used with ""filter"" operation.
They can be found in ""filters"" protocol.

I am polymorphic with ==SpartaSurface==.

!! Public API and Key Messages

- ==fill== - create a builder of fill drawing operation  
- ==stroke== - create a builder of stroke drawing operation
- ==path== - create a path builder
- ==paint== - create a paint builder (linear, radial gradients)
- ==clip== - create a builder to clip canvas by path (or rectangle)
- ==transform== - create a builder to transform canvas
- ==font== - create a font build helper
- ==text== - create a text rendering builder
- ==filter== - create a builder of filter drawing operation
- ==mask== - create a builder of masking draw operation
- ==bitmap== - create a bitmap factory
- ==shape== - create a common shapes factory (ellipse, rounded rectangle, etc)
- ==filters== - create a common filters factory

- ==extent== - get my size (width@height)
- ==similar:== - to create an empty canvas of size anExtent and of the same type and format 
- ==asForm== - to rasterize myself and return resulting image as Form

''I am an abstract class and should not be instantiated. However, the best way to create an instance of sparta canvas is to send extent: message.''

GToolkit,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,"! Rectangle geometry with arrow pointer

The goal of this tutorial is to create an element with an arrow-like pointer in the middle of the top edge, as shown below:
${example:BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation>>#elementWithTopArrowGeometry|noCode|previewShow=gtLiveFor:|previewHeight=250}$

A traditional way to implement such geometry is to create a subclass of ${class:BlGeometry}$,  override ${method:BlGeometry>>#buildPathOnSpartaCanvas:}$ and implement quite cumbersome algorithm that computes the location of each point and then connects those points using ==moveTo:== and ==lineTo:== commands provided by ==PathBuilder==. The problem with such solution is its exponential increase in compolexity each time we would like to parametrize and customize the resulting geometry, for example the size of the arrow or its horizontal position. Even more compex would be to implement the support for positioning the arrow on different edges (e.g. left, bottom) or an ability to have multiple arrows on separate edges.

This is where a ${class:BlVectorShape}$ comes-in handy.

!! Creating a rectangle shape

We will start with creation of the rectangle shape ${class:BlRectangleShape}$:
${example:BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation>>#rectangleShape|previewShow=#gtLiveFor:|previewExpanded=true|previewHeight=250}$

!! Translating the top edge

In order to give the arrow pointing up enough space we should move the top edge of the rectangle down by the length of the arrow. First of all we should ask the rectangle shape to give us its top edge ${method:BlRectangleShape>>#topEdge}$. By default the ==topEdge== of the rectangle is an instance of ${class:BlLineShape}$ which can be translated by sending ${method:BlLineShape>>#moveBy:}$ to the ==topEdge==:
${example:BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation>>#rectangleWithTranslatedTopEdge|previewShow=#gtLiveFor:|previewExpanded=true|previewHeight=250}$

!! Injecting a line inside of the top edge

Next step on our way to the arrow is to inject a line segment equal to the length of the arrow in the middle of the ==topEdge==. It can be done by sending ${method:BlLineShape>>#injectLineAt:length:}$ to the ==topEdge==. Since we want to inject a line right in the middle of the edge we pass ==0.5== as a line location:
${example:BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation>>#rectangleWithTopInjectedLine|previewShow=#gtLiveFor:|previewExpanded=true|previewHeight=250}$

!! Splitting the injected line

We are almost ready to create a rectangular arrow. We just need to split an injected line in half in order to create the top corner of the rectangle. We can do so by sending a ${method:BlLineShape>>#splitAt:}$ to the now middle section of the ==topEdge== which was created by the previous line injection step:
${example:BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation>>#rectangleWithTopPolylineSplitInHalf|previewShow=#gtLiveFor:|previewExpanded=true|previewHeight=250}$

!! Moving the top of the triangle

Once we have everything we need for the arrow triangle we can move it's top up by the length of the arrow. To do so we should send ${method:BlPointShape>>#moveBy:}$ to the connection point of the splitted line in the middle of the ==topEdge==. After doing so we receive the expected vector shape we we can later use together with ${class:BlShapeGeometry}$:

GToolkit,BlLayout,"!Bloc layout
I am the superclass for layouts in Bloc and I define the API that a concrete layout needs to implement.

I am attached to a bloc element and define the visual structure of that bloc element. Tipically this includes the position of child elements within the parent, or the size of the parent element. 

!!Layout constraints
I support a set of attributes (refered to as constraints in Bloc) which define the visual properties of the layout. A small set of constraints, like padding, margin or minimal and maximum dimensions, are common among all the layouts. Each layout has a dedicated constraint objects, instance of ${class:BlLayoutCommonConstraints}$, that contain these common constraints. Each type of layout can further define its own specific constraints by creating a subclass of ${class:BlLayoutConstraints}$. 

TODO: constraints API

!!Layout phase in a frame
Layouting of elements is a phase executed by a space during every frame. 

Every frame, the space goes through several phases (${method:BlSpaceFrame>>#initializePhases}$). Phases are modeled as subclasses of ${class:BlSpaceFramePhase}$ and are executed once per frame. One of them, ${class:BlSpaceFrameLayoutPhase}$, consists in layouting the elements contained in the space. This is done after events and tasks have been executed, but before the drawing phase.

Layouting should to be executed during a frame when various properties like, width, height or position change in any element contained by the space. However, an important aspect in Bloc, is that when one of these properties changes, layouting is not performed immediately. Instead, a layout request is issued by the element whose property changed using the message ${method:BlElement>>#requestLayout:}$. This has the advantage that if no element request layout, this phase can be skipped. Also it does not matter if layout is requeste one or 1000 time; only one layout phase is performed improving performance. 

Hence, in Bloc layout is not executed immediately after a property like the width of an element changes. Instead layout is requested and perfomed, if needed, during every frame. When needing to test layouts, however, it is necessary to apply a layout immediately, instead of waiting for a frame to end. That can be done using the messafe ${method:BlElement>>#forceLayout}$; this should not be used outside of tests, as it bypasses the normal layouting system from Bloc.

In a space where all elements have no event handlers for layout events, elements are going to be layouted exactly once during the layouting phase. However, often elements need to reach and perform actions, when for example their position or extent changes. They can react by requesting another layout. A tipical example is deadling with edges. An edge can be layouted only after the position of the elements that it connects is known. Hence, often the layout needs to be applied twice, or more, during the layouting phase. The space only allows layout requests during the layouting phase a limited number of times (${method:BlSpace>>#computeLayout}$) to avoid blocking rendering due to infinite recursions caused by layout requests, or void spending too much time on layouts in a frame. More technical details can be found in the method ${method:BlSpace>>#doLayout}$, the main entry point for executing the layout phase in a space.

!!Performing a layout
The space starts the layouting process on the root element of that space. Performing the layout on an element consists in executing three main steps:
        - measuring bounds: determine the bounds of the element according to its layout;
        - applying the layout: determine the position of children within the element;
        - commiting changes: raise layout events like position or extent changed.

TODO: why three separate steps?

!!!Measuring bounds
This is the first step when performing a layout on an element and consists in determening the measured bounds of that element. 

Each element can decide how it wants to be measured (${method:BlElement>>#onMeasure:}$). By default ${class:BlElement}$ delegates the measuring to its layout. Layouts should override ${method:BlLayout>>#measure:with:}$ to implement the actual measuring. Normally layouts follow a top to bottom approach: they measure the current element and then asks its children to do the measuring.

Each element has real bounds (${BlElement>>#bounds}$) and measured bounds (${BlElement>>#measuredBounds}$). The real bounds contain the actual position and extent of an element that users of that element should rely on. The measured bounds are used during layouting to hold the new extent of an element. The measuring phase changes only the extent in the measured bounds. After the entire layout phase is completed the real bounds and measured bounds will have the same value. The measured bounds act like a temporary cache for the new bounds of an element. They were introduced to avoid changing the real extent of element while layouting of children is still being performed. 

(TODO: explain why position is sometime changed in the measured bounds)

Moose,MooseEntity,"MooseEntity is an abstract entity. Entities should subclass this class.
Any moose entity should answer its mooseID, its mooseName and its mooseModel.

!!Extension mechanism

The state instance variable provides a mechanism for extending the state of entities. This is achieved through MooseEntityState. Using this mechanism, a package can extend an entity to add more state. This extension will only be visible when the package is loaded. This is an important mechanism to enable extensibility and modularity. 

For example, if you have YourEntity that subclasses MooseEntity, you can extend it with:

YourEntity>>yourExtendingAttribute
        ^ self privateState attributeAt: #yourExtendingAttribute
YourEntity>>yourExtendingAttribute: aValue
        ^ self privateState attributeAt: #yourExtendingAttribute put: aValue

(see MooseEntityState for more information)


!!Meta descriptions

Entities should also be meta-described in terms of Fame. This is achieved by means of pragmas:

- First, on the class side, you should have a method . For example, YourEntity could have
YourEntity class>>annotation

        <package: 'YourPackage'>
        <MSEComment: 'The YourEntity Smalltalk class has a correspondent YourEntity meta entity in the Fame world'>

- The pragma <MSEProperty:type:> must be placed in the getter method to denote a Fame property. For example:
YourEntity>>yourExtendingAttribute

        <MSEComment: 'This is an attribute extended in a different package'>

- mooseModel of an entity is must be an instance of MooseModel. It may be nil if the entity is not part of a model.

Moose,FMModel,"Description
--------------------

I am a model used in the scope of Fame.

I contains real instances of a class representing a concept in the current metamodel. This class is described by an entity of my meta-model. 

I have a meta-model containing descriptions of my content. A FMModel has a FMMetaModel as meta-model which has a FMMetaMetaModel has metamodel. 

For example, in the Smalltalk metamodel of Famix, if we want to represent the Point class we will have:
- A FMModel containing an instance of FamixStClass representing the Point class.
- A FMMetaModel containing instances of FM3Elements describing FamixStClass.
- A FMMetaMetaModel containing instances of FM3Element describing FM3 meta model (Package, Class and Property).

I include a system of caches in case my users want to store informations to speed up an application.

I will initialize myself with a new FMMetaModel but this one can be replaced by an existing one.

Moose,TDependencyQueries,"Description
--------------------

This trait provides a common, paradigm agnostic vocabulary to query dependencies of software entities.

It includes some generic way to query an entity via its associations. The API offer the possibility to query an entity with three parameters:
- The direction of the navigation (Incoming/Outgoing -- in/out)
- The kind of association (FAMIXAcces, FAMIXReference, all...)
- The scope of the query (The receiver, the receiver and its children)

The actual core of the algorithms are in MooseQueryCalculator class.

Most  of the generic methods takes a symbol to describe the direction. This symbol will be used to find a MooseQueryAbstactDirectionStrategy to configure a MooseQueryCalculator.

Public API and Key Messages
--------------------

- #query: aSymbol with: aFAMIXAssociation                                 Looks for the associations of the kind aFAMIXAssociation in the direction described by the symbol in the receiver and its children.
- #queryLocal: aSymbol with: aFAMIXAssociation                 Looks for the associations of the kind aFAMIXAssociation in the direction described by the symbol in the receiver.
- #queryAll: aSymbol                                                                         Looks for the associations in the direction described by the symbol in the receiver and its children.

There is a lot of other generic queries. You can find all of them in the ""moose-queries-generic"" protocol.

        aFAMIXClass query: #in with: FAMIXInheritance.
                --> Will return a MooseIncomingQueryResult containing the FAMIXInheritance associations having aFAMIXClass or its children as target
                        
        aFAMIXMethod query: #out with: FAMIXAccess.
                --> Will return a MooseOutgoingQueryResult containing the FAMIXAccess associations having aFAMIXMethod or its children as source
